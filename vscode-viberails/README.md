## AI Coding, With Guardrails

VibeRails is the control layer for AI coding inside VS Code. Work faster with Claude, Codex, Gemini, and Copilot while keeping output consistent, reviewable, and secure.

## Key Features

- Environment Isolation: Like Conda for LLMs. Experiment with settings without breaking your primary setup.
- Cross-LLM Learning: Share context and learnings across Claude, Codex, and Gemini.
- RAG Without The Rot: Track repeated fixes, feature descriptions, and file changes so context stays useful.
- Few Shot Prompting: Get Gemini or Codex to code like Claude, with up to 20% better performance.
- Rule Enforcement: Enforce standards before code gets pushed.
- Token Savings: Use smarter file hints to reduce token usage and cost.

## Secure by Design

- Secure local dashboard access.
- Isolated environment profiles for each workflow.
- Rule checks and session visibility help prevent risky changes from slipping through.
