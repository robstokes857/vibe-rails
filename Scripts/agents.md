# Scripts - Agent Notes

## TODO
- **Update install scripts in the front-end solution** - The `install.ps1` and `install.sh` scripts are also bundled/copied into the front-end build output (e.g. `VibeRails/bin/*/net10.0/`, `deploy/artifacts/`). After modifying the source scripts here in `Scripts/`, make sure the copies in the front-end solution are updated too (rebuild or re-copy).
